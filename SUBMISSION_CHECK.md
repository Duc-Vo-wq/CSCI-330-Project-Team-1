# Submission Check (TEAM 1)

Before you submit, confirm **all items below exist** and are complete.

## Required files (root of this zip)
- [ ] `requirements.txt` (lists any non-standard Python packages you used; can be empty if none)
- [ ] `RUN.md` (filled out — commands you ran on your machine)
- [ ] `RUBRIC_50_POINTS.md` (read it; ensure you met each category)
- [ ] `START_HERE.md` (use the exact run command shown there)

## Required files (inside `assignment/`)
- [ ] `assignment/recon_report.py` (your final script — runs without crashing)
- [ ] `assignment/recon.json` (generated by your script; matches the JSON template)
- [ ] `assignment/recon.md` (generated by your script; matches the MD template)

## Quick sanity tests
1) Run your script exactly as shown in `START_HERE.md`
2) Confirm the outputs update **today** (not older files)
3) Open the generated JSON and confirm it is valid JSON (no trailing commas, etc.)
4) Compare structure/field names to `assignment/OUTPUT_TEMPLATE_*.json` and `assignment/OUTPUT_TEMPLATE_*.md`

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Submitting templates instead of generated outputs
- Changing file names (grader expects the names above)
- Running outside the approved target/scope (see `TARGETS.md`)
- Leaving `RUN.md` blank
