# VM Acquisition Options (Course Default: ISO Install)

## Default (everyone): Install Ubuntu from ISO
Use: `ISO_INSTALL_GUIDE.md`

## Optional (only if instructor provides it later): Import an OVA
If an instructor-provided `.ova` is posted on the LMS:
- VirtualBox → File → Import Appliance…
Then continue with `LOCAL_LAB_SETUP.md` for Host-only networking and your team static IP.

## Note
This team zip includes `INSTRUCTOR_OVA_EXPORT_GUIDE.md` for the instructor, but students should assume ISO install unless told otherwise.
